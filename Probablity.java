super npissed and taken advantage ofk amazing I wanted a charger and headphones for thatk But I did not get anykk I requested the amazon teamk But there is no actionk Phone works how it should but at

former Samsung userk itks taking me some time to get used to the different OSk but I am impressed with the elegance of how the whole thing worksk I bought this iphone for my mom and so far it has been working greatk The battery is really good like brand new and the phone only has two small scratchesk It arrived without original box and it only contained USB charger which is not original eitherk So you only get the phone I guess and if anything happens I will update my reviewk Love the phone but but since i bought it it freezes a lotkkk Itks just what I expeced The phone arrived fine and everything but after the 30 day warranty was up my phone kmagicallyk started having issuesk The actually phone casing itself is losek the entire phone is kind of bending kto be fair that might be my faultkk I literally just plugged my charger in and it went from 11k to 52k in the blink of an eyek I unplugged it and it went back down to 12kk Sometimes Ikll put my phone face down on my desk and when I pick it back up the screen is frozen on whatever I was doing last causing me to restart the phonek It was fine at first but thereks sooooo much going wrongkk Is a good device easy to handle You

slowk It was working well for a month then it started freezing occasionally and shutting down on itks own Unfortunately I was in a bind and desperately needed a new phonek I bought this phone because

and to check the timek Two months later the phone already dies on 30k+; has an overall short battery life after chargingk and frequently freezes k also when listening to musick I cankt have the phone

everything works wellk however i know I was lucky cause buying this stuff here is a gamble k my previous purchasek the same iphonek was broken The refurbish process for iPhones is not goodk Bought two of these and they broke after about 4 months of basic usek I guess they were broken the first time for a reasonk Once it is a lemon it is always a lemonk The screens on both of these quit responding

iPhonek Actually the review for Trianium case belongsnherek I will not repeatk Suffice to say the refurbkd 6 and the lime green protective case are the talk of my housek Excellent packaging and

itks not applek had no problem setting it up to metro pcsk The reason why I have it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it did not have headphones and not an apple charger Really grand Refurbished iPhone6 k works perfectlyk Quick shipment  good secure packagingk Would refer friends  buy something like this againk Phone worked great for 3 monthsk Then touch screen started acting up and is no longer usablek I was very careful with phone and placed in Life Proof case immediately and never droppedk Just a crappy phonek First time writing a reviewk I hastily ordered this phone after my iPhone

thrilledk Battery life is greatk No scratches or dingsk As others postedk it did come with a cheaper chargerk but as my existing charger is compatible I really didnkt carek Based on my purchase alonek I would recommendk Works finek Set up service in Canada for the 2 weeks I am herek I am planning too set it up in the US when I get backk Good working as expected k Looks very neat and will pass for a brand new iPhonek I recommend it for personal use The phone wasnkt UNLOCKEDk I tried to contact the seller and never got an answerk The phone works perfectk Just what I wanted the one and only thing that ruins it is that the shutter sound will not turn off no matter whatk And I cankt even snap in class which sucks The cell phone arrived in excellent conditionk no scratchesk completely newk So far I have not had any problems with itk I recommend itk I have AT  T so I had no problems using itk I will continue to update this I am having several problems with this phonekk Ikve had a 6 iPhone for over a year but this one has issuesk its good device and I like it AAA+ My son loves this phonek It works great and the shopping experience was greatk No problem I needed a replacement for my IPhone 5 and this was a cost effective alternative to the Iphone 7 that had a lot that I did not needk I have found refurbished products to bek in many waysk better than new since they were extensively evaluated in the refurb processk In terms of overall qualityk I can find no differences between refurb and newk Works great k unlocked as advertised on Cricket kATTk networkk The screen has quit sensing touch at the bottom good as newkkk Very nice phone iPhone 6 k I like it a lot Got the phone and plugged it into the chargerk Didnkt turn onk didnkt turn on in recovery modek Ikm a student dealing with finals week and no phonek Very disappointed in this company and purchasek It needed a new battery had to buy one The phone worksk but has terrible battery life and sometimes wonkt show that the battery percentage is decreasingk Ikve tried to factory reset it three timesk but that does not fix itk Was not as advertisedk The product was fine in appearance but once I started using it it wouldnkt stop glitching and it was very annoying to use because it would press buttons on itks ownk The battery also died very quickly and it packaging wise it didnkt arrive the day it was suppose tok k very good This iphone6 battery is so bad The phone is in excellent condition but it seems to have two operating systemsk I shut down on its own kshowing that the battery life was exhaustedk but when I repowered more battery life was availablek Additionallyk the battery ran out too soonk I asked for a refund and did not receive one in a timely manner and when I attempted to contact the company all I received was an automated systemk The phone itself was nicek but slightly bentk My carrier is Straight Talk and I purchased a SIM card for this phonek Service worked for about an hour total and then the phone would read searching or no service in the upper left cornerk I purchased three new SIM cardsk I spent hours trying to resolve this issue with Straight Talk customer service and they were as helpful as could be but at the end of the dayk it was a problem with the phone not reading the SIM cardk The SIM card jack looked slightly bentk this may have been the contributing factork Either wayk I would warn to not buy this if you use straight talkk I went to Walmart and bought an iphone that was already set up through straight talk and it has been working finek Excellent phonek My daughter is very happyk Works great with our MetroPcs accountk Great productk thank youk Cellphone came in good conditionk but battery life was really badk Once it hit 30kk it shut off

condition Beautiful phone came on time and was all that I could have ever wantedk A Month later it starts to stall when typingk kMinor issue so I didnkt complaink now all of a sudden barely holds a chargek Out of nowhere it gets really HOT and shutdowns Ikm without a phone for hoursk Comes back on when it wants to sometimes that can take a full dayk Now I am kind of skeptical of refurbished anythingk Not really wanting refurbished items again anymorek Service was quick and greatk But overall the phones Bluetooth donkt work and wifi goes in an outk Got the phone last week I changed it

received my phone today and connected it to MetroPCSk It was in the box and looked brand newk I was worried after reading some reviews of nothing being in the box when it showed up but I did not have that experiencek I will update my review if the phone does not work properly but for now Ikm giving 5 stars because it got here in 2 daysk looks brand newk got it connected with no problemk and is

daughter broke her original iPhone and this was an affordable and money well spent optionk Once it arrived she took it to the Verizon store and they transferred her info from the old broken phone to

not turn on what so ever after hours of charging When I received the phone I found many scratches on the body and with bad charger and failed battery this is cunning seller I returned my product due to the battery being defected and not working properlyk If you have no issue with thatk then this would be a great purchase the phone was in great shape aside from the batteryk Some small software glitches as wellk but I figure that is due to the phone being unlockedk However the return was easy no hasslek It came without headphones is the only issuek The iPhone came in excellent conditions It to small for iphone 6 Its battery has serious problemk When i use the phonek the battery worn out so fast and sometimes it turns off suddenlyk If i donkt connect a chargerk it wonkt turn onk The item

it was new but adequate Had this phone for a couple monthsk never dropped it or anything but the buttons are stuck in the phone and the screen is popping outk Good conditionk Never buy a new phone againk The iPhone came on time and looks brand new on the front and back with little scratches on the left near the volume buttonsk but idgaf I still recommendk The camera is crystal clear took I bought the space grey iPhone if wanted to knowk Just Perfect Fast and great valuek I never wrote a review beforekkkI thought itks time to give backk since I relay on ";

easierk I can hear all sounds coming from my phone like musickcallskvideos and I can be across the room at the same timek Screen is loosek phone has had a few glitches since receiving itk Nothing unbearable but somewhat irritatingk Ikm conflicted as to what to write about this productk Ikve only had my iPhone 6 for 10 daysk and am already experiencing significant issues with itk The main issue being the phone is either using a corrupt batteryk or thereks a shortage in the circuitk Even if the phone is at 60k battery life it powers off with no warningk Had a bad batteryk This company doesnkt do much QA on used stuffk Great Productk Phone does not charge at all Phone stopped working within 2 weeks it just goes to the I phone screen and goes blankk just like my previous I phone 6 did of 1k5 years but this one was 2 weeks oldk So I buy an I Phone 5 from amazon a few weeks later thinking it must be an I phone 6 problemk the phone I phone 5 stopped working 3 weeks laterk i order this phone and got it quick k it had no scratches or dents works just fine also it does work with METRO PCS if u are going to connect it to metrok so happy i got this Iphone 6 64gb sliver k i did put a case on it bu without it k it t looks like new Holla Amazonkcom is complicit in the resell of defective phonesk I purchased two defective phonesk Amazon has not performed a Bin Check on these defective items k it would be a large profit loss and they continue to be soldk My first defective phone had faulty hardware k the screen was blinking at the edges and the touch screen did not workk The second had a defective power system and would suddenly shut downk It is clear that manyk if not the majority of these kCertified Refurbishedk phones are known by the reseller to be defective and Amazon has not

iphone due to not being able to charge itk Thank goodness it was returnablek I cankt notice any difference between this product and a new iPhonek Came in correct colork and in fewer days than

phone is as good as new without any scratchesk Until now itks been working greatk As describedk it came with a generic charger and cable without any headphonesk The only problem is that it does not

bit skeptical after reading other reviews but I experienced no problemsk Seems to be working finek However the battery drains a bit too fast for my likingk Otherwisek no scratchesk While this is indeed an unlocked iPhonek it is the Japanese versionk and therefore the camera shutter sound CANNOT be turned offk unless you do some jailbreaking which we were not prepared to dok It is unfortunate that the description doesnkt mention this anywherek The phone was awesomek either newk or virtually sok although it came with a nonkApple chargerk The shipping was exactly as promisedk the customer service was quick when I wanted to returnk itks just a shame that the phone isnkt quite as advertisedk Itks very good Arrived in great conditionk No scratches or dingsk I have heard this with many refurbished phones and it stands true with this one the battery is not greatk It does last most of the day but does almost immediately if you open any apps once the battery gets to 30kk Also dies quickly if it gets cold kmy old iPhone did this tookk Overall for the price I am very happy The phone looks fine but the WikFi is not as other iPhonesk With my other iPhone 6 I was able to connect to WikFi from my room but with this one it cankt connect as if it didnkt reachk Another issuek even when its muted the camera shutter sound effect always makes the sound and its loudk Works great Unfortunatelyk the sirikvoice doesnkt work wellk It answers either no match found or dials a number when I asked for the population of a city or weather or anythingk Alsok it just blacks out when Ikm in the middle of a call and am on hold and need to press optionsk With a black screenk I cankt push anything and even power off doesnkt work so I just have to wait until the call endsk For these reasons I had to return itk I did try to trouble shoot and Amazon recommended I call the seller but my call was not returnedk first i was very happy this was yesterday sunday 16 april once i opened then on the back comes with 2 or 3 visible scratches i feel very dissapointed kk cause they are next to the camera eye and for my bad luck i cant return it cause am a carnival cruise l crewmember and

Momk Review Datek on April 11k 2017k Ratingk 1k0 out of 5 The phone arrived quickly and in great conditionk everything seemed fine at firstk A couple of days into use I realized that the mic did not workk which for me is a big problem because I take quick notes with the mic constantlyk Alsok the Bluetooth wouldnkt workk no matter what type of troubleshooting we didk No mic + No bluetooth = returned phonek I used the phone for another day or two while waiting for my new one to come ink The screen began fading off and on to the point that it couldnkt be readk I did a hard shutdownk recharged it and started it back up againk After a couple of minutes the screen went back to normalk so I quickly erase all data from the phone and put it in the box for returnk Accesories are not original and phone is not working properlykbattery is completely deadk During charging it goes up to k90 from k8k I was very surprisedk This item did not work wellk GPS was inaccuratek screen did not

the country and am supposed to pay 70 USD to ship it back to the USk Sok the end of my story isk I lost timek energy and money in trying to buy a refurbished phonek My advicek Do not ever buy a refurbished phone and donkt trust Amazon blindly to help you when you are most frustrated with your defective productk WikFi barely works Works greatkk Was just as postedk Thanks for you quick servicek I bought this Iphone as a presentk and when I finally opened It I couldnkt even set up the Iphone because the touch screen didnkt work at allk I sent an email to the companyk but I still didnkt get an answerk I look forward fo a solutionk It did work good for 5 months than when i clic one letter a different one would pop upk or if I would clic an app a different one will pop upk

I am very happy with purchasek 128GBs for this pricek NOTHING CAN BEAT THATk will be recommending this to others kk I received an empty boxk containing just an iphone charger and not the iphone i paid for k When the phone arrived it was in good condition other than one small dent k later that week the battery became faulty and the phone continuously turned off Phone randomly shuts off for no reasonk if I want to actually use my phone I have to have it on a charger but there are still times it shuts offkkkkkkkkk and the phone freezes all the timekk Worst phone ever Came in perfect condition and perfect rappingk Like newk Ikm very pleased it was half way broken when it arrivedk Looks like new not a single scratch came in a good box and is certified has the 30 day money back which is great every one who says theirs had no phone they lied because Amazon loves itks costomers and gives the full money back so I recommend this phone even their are no risksk Phone worked just fine and quite normally until the warranty went outk Coincidencek Maybek Then all of the sudden wouldnkt recommend gnome the chargerk Took unit to get fixed wasnkt the batterykk wasnkt the charging portk said it was an operational system issuek Fantastick Emailed this seller asking about options because literally the warranty went out like that daykkk uhkk no responsek So to me now certified refurbished is like warmed up leftoversk This phone was not compatible with ATT as indicated in the item descriptionk The phone looked almost new and it was shipped the same day I ordered itk but ATT was not able to activate it because they said itks not compatiblek Everything was greatk The only inconvenience was that I had paid for Two day delivery and the package arrived three days laterk Most importantly the phone came in perfect conditions kjust a few scratches on the Apple logok and one hardly noticeable scratch on the screenkk What I loved the most about this purchase is the great upgrade it was from my Xperia Z2 in terms of comfort and GB capacity k64 GB vs roughly 11 GBkk Something really nice about this change is that the phone setup includes the Move to iOS option in which you can transfer all data to your iPhone from your Androidk and it just makes your life much easierk I love it Perfect conditionk This phone lasted 35 daysk It died because that happens sometimesk Had an Apple store check out the phone and the best response I got was its not able to be repairedk So I paid k10 a day for a phone so a full star rating is too muchk Just like newk Greatk A Happy 16th birthday present for my daughterkkkkk She loving itkkkk I bought this phone and it looked to be in great conditionk Everything worked great except when I make calls there is a horrible buzzing noise and the person on the other end cannot hear mek It only goes away if I use speaker phonek I called the seller because I have a 90 day warrantyk Which means they will give me a refund once I return the phonek They will not replace itk Not happyk Excelent Ordered this refurbished iPhone 6 64gb for my teenage daughter to replace her 16gbk The phone was in excellent conditionk looked newk We charged the phone overnight per instructions to ensure battery lifek After a month of usek it continues to function like a new phone and has very long battery lifek Would buy againk Excellent productk in

the phone if I was able as it seems to have a mind of its ownk I have instances the screen would go blankk Screen didnkt work Product looks fine and it seems to function okk It was described as

get a phone thatks almost new tho now Ikm disappointed to see that I was sold a used phone and not a refurbished onek Good phone the wifi works only when youkre really close to the antennak when the battery is drained it takes a lot of time k20 minutesk to turn on againk Cankt turn of camera sound and it is dirty insidek The phone works but after 3 days of having itk it started to close apps

in love with themk I used Metro Pcs and if works perfect k I have two little issues with themk One is that it was supposed to be 16 GB but when I got it k it was only 11 GB kk that really upset me + I

phone for 2 or 3 weeks and itks perfectly fine besides those 2 issuesk Other then that I love it k The volume button did not workk phone kept going off at random timesk at random volume levelsk Returned the item and have been trying to get a refundk but itks taking FOREVER for them to process the paperworkk Not happyk just passed warranty period and it isnkt holding a charge Thank you kkWorks perfectly and New conditionkFast shipping Donkt get it Bought it for my 13 year old granddaughter and it works great and she loves itkk It works like a charmk my only gripe is just a minor thingk When I change it between silent and the ringer the switch can be a bit fidgetyk Great phonek no problems with it I wasnkt informed that the phone was from another countryk The shutter noise is impossible to get rid of unless I jail break itk So no Ikm not satisfied with the phonek It stopped working kkkknever got to use it Great productk Does exactly what I need it to do and has plenty of storage spacek I love itk been waiting to be apart of team iPhone like my fiancé for some time and it surprised me by arriving earlyk  I was super happyk Still to this day it works perfectly finek My phone looks and works like newk Very good phone I like it It s an used kold phone k As an Apple user for over a decadek Ikm terribly disappointed at this phonekFor startersk the battery is dysfunctional and empties in a few hoursk then goes from 1k straight to 35k as soon as I plug it in the chargerk The phone also often shuts down on its own when the battery is 20kk Moreoverk the phone is slow which makes the user experience terriblek Applications hang and touch sometimes doesnkt work on screenk Fingerprint unlock is also slowk This is no where near an apple phonek Very disappointingk It works fine and it was in good condition when I took it out the boxk But thereks one thing Ikm not so satisfied aboutk Itks just that every time I take a picture the Sound always goes off and I cankt turn it off smhk But other than that I like itk battery issuek the phone shutdowns automatically with 20k left of chargek I claimed for a refund but they denied itk Very bad sellerk worse product I got my phone today and at first I noticed that the screen had been replaced and whoever replaced the screen did not line it up correctly and there is adhesive over the ear speaker and almost covered the front mount camerak And the volume but does not workk Customer service was not helpful at all about getting me replacement and suggested that I just buy the other one that they had availablek I would not recommend buying a phone through this company Best Buy offers used and refurbished phones go there firstk Very happy with this product The phone never picked the signal Awesome phonek worked fine for two monthsk then it stopped getting signalk called amazon support they told me phone its defectivek so if you buy this phone consider getting the extra replacement warranty that cost like 70 bucksk otherwise you risk getting stuck with a defective phone after the first 30 days It took forever to come but I had absolutely no problem with my phonek It was activated through MetroPcs with no problemk It took 5 minutes to activatek Phone looks brand new and everything works properlyk I purchased this a little over a month agok Excellent phone it works greatk No problem install with the local phone carrier Great phone No issues Love itk Excelent product and quickly shipping YES MY DAUGHTER LOVED IT Perfect Wifi is not working correctlyk I am very dissatisfied with this product and the sellers responsiveness to the request for supportk I have called 4 timesk they returned 1 call with a voicemailkkkkkI do NOT recommendk I like the iPhone 6k kk I returned this itemk Great phone I bought the phone through the seller BREEDk I am satisfied with the condition small scratches but otherwise phone was in perfect conditionk Do not use the charger that comes with the phonek The charger worked for one day then appeared to be charging the next day but drained my battery insteadk I went and purchased an Apple charger and had no more charging issuesk The touch screen acts up from time to timek Not really sure what the issue iskto fix I press the side off key then the home button sometimes a few times and it works againkk That is why only a 4 star ratingk When I inquired with TkMobile about why my NEW phones reception was worse than my old iPhone 5k the technician told me that this phone was not meant for TMobilek So it would not reach certain towersk I am very disappointed to hear that and wish I wouldkve been informed of that information before I purchased this phonek Pefectkkk bought if to use if with Metro PCSk worked perfectlyk just as expected thanksk Mines came in great condition no scrapesk scratchesk or cracks and came with a charger the only down part is you need a sim cardk The iPhone I bought had a loose wifi antenna to itk Straight garbage and such an inconveniencek Certified refurbishedk More like certified trashk Came in great conditionk I had to buy a new battery because it wouldnkt hold a charge but that has been the only problem so fark Very happy with this purchasek Delivery was fast as promisedk So fark the product works greatk Good smart phonekIkve had this phone for about a month all was good then my signal went out and where it used to show my signal bars got replaced by no service or searchingkkk excellent conditionk would recommendk I got this phone for my daughterk she loves it and she has had no problemsk Glad I made the choice to get a refurbished phone I love my phone  the price was more than worth itk Excellent phone looks new but battery dies randomly phone will say 100k and it diesk

returned it everything was just as it should have beenk very happy with itk My son has been asking for an IPhone for yearsk Finally bought him onek He loves itk battery life is very bad and not charging this phone not buy this iPhone This iPhone 6 is everything and then somek Coming from android to iPhonek why did I wait so longk I just love this fun for everything it doesk It is very easy and smooth to usek Just tap on the icon and it opens within secondsk Love Itk I donkt write reviews very often but I must say I was very impressed with this purchasek And so was my son the phone was for him and so far so goodk I was scared due to the old reviewsk my phone came super newk and working perfectlyk good Totally recommendedk Itks working great kk In perfect conditionk Only complaint was that the cords they sent with the phone didnkt work k but I had an iPhone charger alreadyk so I wasnkt concernedk I felt like I was taking a risk ordering this productk and was so so relieved when

    String str3="hearing the fact that I was taking a picturek Poor Phone k glitches in the phone started after a month k it is not working properly kat times automatically call gets disconnect DO NOT BUY THIS PHONEk IT IS A KNOCK OFF THE CAMERA QUALITY IS DIRT POOR AND THE BATTERY RUNS DOWN TO 0k IN 4 HOURSk I CANkT BELIEVE I PAID SO MUCH MONEY AND GOT SCAMMED Works finek but a little bit slow for a new phonek This product arrived on time  in good packagingk But one thing that is a total deal breaker for me is that there is no easy way to turn off the camera shutter soundk It doesnkt work with turning your volume offk if your ok with your camera making a loud shutter sound every single time you take a picture for the whole time you have this phone than its good for you but if you take slot of pictures than Ikm assuming the noise will end up annoying youk Good product but has the one thing that would make me returnk The battery on this phone dose not last more than a day k Excelente producto I love my iPhone 6 yes they came unlock Great love itk It came right on timek The IPhone 6 was good except for I cankt turn off the sound when I take picturesk The bottom of the screen was lifting off the phone Phone has battery shortagek It worked for a weekk it shuts off when it wants too I listen to music and the phone advances the songsk and the worse thing is that already wants to load and I am just going to fulfill the 3 months with the I bought this item as Apple certified but it came defectivek I had to go to all the returning process Waited almost a full week for the phone to get here but when I took it in to my phone carrierk The phone would not activatek They tried two different SIM cards and it would not activate for either of themk After seeing k50k 5kstar reviews and k30k 1kstar reviewsk I decided to gamble on itk And I got unluckyk The sellerk Viusk shipped the phone promptlyk and at first glancek it looked goodk Then I realizedk k it had a number of dents and scratchesk including one big one I could see from an armks lengthk That alone violated what Amazonks Certified Refurbished guaranteed kno visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches awaykk I donkt know how Vius missed thisk k the sockets kcharging portk SIM card slotk earphone jackk even the speaker holesk had a lot of dirt in themk I found out when I couldnkt properly fit the charging plug ink Ikve owned an iPhone 5 for almost four yearsk and Ikve never gotten my ports this clogged upkkk Wellk Ikm not too picky about thatk actuallyk So I cleaned out all the ports and got down to checking the phonek My carrier could be detected k3Gk callsk and SMSkk memory indeed was 128Gbk camera and audio were workingk and the display was greatk Then I realized the battery was draining extremely quickly despite an initial 6khour chargek After fully charging it twice morek I couldnkt get it to last more than 6 hoursk It would reach around 50k and then suddenly diek When opening the Settings k Battery portionk there was a notice that I needed to have the battery servicedk Grantedk other sellers might give a better phone than what I gotk so check the actual seller out before buyingk I rated Vius with two stars because at least they delivered what I ordered on time and not some empty boxk But in terms of the actual productk its goodkaskdead battery makes it useless to me despite everything else workingk What a shamek Phone works perfectly fine but when I take a picture and the phone is on silent it still has the click sound you would get if your phone wasnkt on silentk and the phone doesnkt vibrate The phone is greatk I just wish there was a was to turn off the loud shutter sound when taking picturesk ITS SO ANNOYINGLY LOUDk I tried putting the volume all the down and using the button of the left side to mute the soundk Apparentlyk thereks no way to mute itk Otherwisek itks a good phonek The phones switches off without me doing it and the screen occasionally get darks especially whenever i am outdoorsk Had to return it The phone came and was in perfect condition along with the other one that I purchasedk One of them took the TkMobile Sim card perfectly and the other continued to say searching and eventually said no service k Ikm ordering a second one now after being refunded for the first one and Ikm hoping that it will be T mobile compatible as advertisedk Overall the only reason this product didnkt get the full five stars was that one of the two iPhones did not work when I put the SIM card ink Fast shipping  good quality otherwisek It didnkt meet my expectations because I couldnkt access the Amazon flex I downloaded on my iPhone 6k Itks says the apps is not from a trusted sourcek Thank u my new phone works great Havenkt had any issue for over 3 monthsk Good value and easy linked to tkmobile Received it fast kgreat productkk Worth the money Clean good conditionk The phone did not work at allk The apple store checked it and found outk that the mainboard has a unfixable mistakek Main mistake no 9 No ear phones and charger was not original so far so good Works great came in a little bent but no biggie The product which I got is just look like brand new Perfect phone not original storage box but they toll you that on the description The IPhone Batery was deadk sometimes doesent recognize the sim making

fiancée as he broke his phonek Great value and works like newk Couldnkt be happierk Working beautifullyk This phone was exactly as advertisedk I would trust this company againk The phone is finek but the SIM card plate is defectivek Every once in a while the SIM keeps coming out of place and when it does that my phone begins to search for network and it takes up to 24 hours to find a network back which is very inconvenient k Is there anyway that I can get my I SIM card plate repair kk Phone did not workk The home button would cause the phone to freezek If not frozen the touch screen would not workk Would not make outgoing callsk Incoming calls would not ring but would show a return to call notification that you could not get tok Thankfully my local storekcarrier where I was getting it activated was kind and patient enough to check and work with me before I left the store with a broke phonek Not unlocked as advertisedk Fast delivery and great itemk Thank youk After about a monthk everything is still working perfectlyk Great product for the pricek the phone was flawlessk The iPhone looked and felt brand newk The phone is great but beware you could get a Japanese phone that wonkt let you take pictures silentlyk Was extremely annoyed by thisk The battery was the first to go out less than a month with the productk Two months after the product the screen started flickering for no apparent reasonk and now the power button isnkt workingk When reaching out to Techarvard the reseller and asking for advice or a refund the response was simplyk Nok This was the total sum of the advicek It was a risk buying from an unknown resellerk but took the chance and would not make the mistake again even though we were told it was certified and like newk it really isnktk Perfect gift for my husbandkkk Phone is good minus one minor problem the charging port doesnkt always workk I love my new phonek absolutely no issues at all Battery always empty Came on time great product and great price thank you Amazon Received the phone Deck 9k of course now that all chance of getting refund or fixed it is not workingk Bad luck I guessk the product was mentioned certified refurbished

if possiblek I tried to call your customer service numberk Great productk Phone was in ok condition but something is wrong with hardware cannot FaceTime or I message The battery is defectivek The phone shuts off due to battery failure even when it still has 50k chargek disappointedkThe charger and the cable I received are not apple originalsk I also did not receive the headset that came with the devicek This product is good for only a few months then the battery starts acting glitchy and it REALLY ANNOYINGkk DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCTkk Dont make the mistake I did by spending k378 for a phone that is going to mess up later This phone is on the black list kkkkkk About 1 week after I received my purchase the phone started acting strangek glitching and making it unable to usek I cankt say exactly what the problem is but I will be sending it back as it has become unusablek Battery doesn not work properly I would like a refund this phone cuts off and wonkt turn back on unless I put

line and works pretty well I started looking for an IPhone 6 a few weeks agokran across this  refurbished  ad and the price is very attractivek start reading reviews andkkkkkk it looks a little riskyk The positive reviews Ikve seen almost look stagedkkkk so I put it offk I finally after a couple more weeks and not finding anything else that came close to k352 for an iPhone 6 gold 128gb said well itks on Prime and itks guaranteed satisfactionkkk soon riskk I bought 2 of them k both are amazingk no scratches no marksk no missing phone on deliveryk no bait and switch k just exactly what I orderedk Both phones have new batteries and are in new condition I have had my phone for about a month I took it off the charger at 4am and it is now 9k25pm and Ikm still at 40k kkkkk donkt be a skeptickkkkk this is one hell of a deal and well worth the money So terrible experience k Front camera donkt work Great This phone is very good  everyone should buy itk any bad reviews is a lie Tried to activate the phonek and it came back as stolenk Ikm returning the phonek Got the phone it was it good condition but it wouldnkt charge out all so the anticipation wasnt worth it send it back still waiting on a refund I usually absolutely love Apple productsk This one I do not thoughk The microphone on it has terrible qualityk When you put the phone on silentk it does not completely silence the phonek The phone will be sitting on the table not being touched and then itks like someone is messing with the volume buttonsk It just has many glitchesk Updatek The seller you purchase this from makes a huge differencek My original review is below for the first device i purchasedk It came with a 30 day return policyk I wish Amazon separated devices to be sold my seller so the review would be true to the actual product and sellerk The second device was from Chubbiestechk Amazingk Packaging was professional looking and the phone looked brand newk It charged up wonderfully and the battery is fantastic so fark It came with a 90 day warranty through Amazon and he seller which is awesome as wellk So glad I took another chance and bought from this sellerk I highly recommend them if you do decide to buy this refurbk Itks a bonus that itks an actual Amazon certified refurbished productk I gave two stars because the return process was awesomek I received the product as a gift for my motherk When I opened the box a generic cord and cube were available as describedk The phone looked amazingk no scratches dentsk or dustk No signs of wear at allk The phone arrived complelty deadk Took an entire 12 hours on a genuine apple cordk which I ownk until it finally turned onk Set up was easy and wifi worked greatk The battery seemed to be lacking from the beginningk I have purchased a refurbished phone before and it lasted years with no issuesk This phone would not hold a chargek would go from 0k to 40k quickly then die as soon as you unplugged itk After two weeks it finally could no longer be unplugged if you wanted to receive calls or texts because it would go from 100k charge to offk I tried resetting the phonek complelty erasing everythingk nothing workedk At the end of the return period I finally was able to get it back from my mom so we could send itk For the cost of the phone I expected so much morek I am thankful I purchased through Amazon because the returns are always hassle freek I suggest looking inotnseler information before purchasingk Phone doesnkt hold a chargek I unplug it in the morning and in less then 10 minutes its already lost 20k of its chargek When not in use all day it will die in a matter of hoursk Have emailed for a refund and I am waiting for a responsek Only have had the phone for a month and a halfk Waste of moneyk Phone works perfectk My son was pleasedk it took little to know activation to start working DOES NOT TAKE A CHARGEk REAL BIG HEADACHE FOR MEk PRODUCT DOES NOT WORKk This is a great phone aside for the fact i have had it for less than 24 hours and the phone cankt hold a charge after speaking with apple support i now have to go into the apple store a get the battery replaced for k80k Yeah k80 isnkt a lot but the fact that in the description the phone was listed as like new to me that should mean that the battery is fully functioningk So now i have to go shell out more money for the battery to be replaced yeah not happy will not order from this dealer againk Completely unsatisfied with this phonek I have sent the phone to Indiak when I am doing Vedio call to the phone which switching off in middle of the

agok but Ikm barely finding out that the phone isnkt 100k silent while on silent modek I tried to find out what the phoneks country of origin isk and I wasnkt able to find anythingk I know itks illegal in some countries to have your phone COMPLETELY silentk and I may have that type of phone––unfortuntaely Nice Itks good Item was as expected The charger is not workingk So I have to order another charger with an extra costk It scared me if the phone is also may function for long timek Refurbishedk Phone will not hold a chargek Will never order electronics from Amazon againk My night started out with pure enthusiasm as I found out my iPhone arrivedk Soon that enthusiasm would go awayk The first problem with the phone started out smallk but rather annoyingk the mute button was defectivek I would mearly breath on the phonek if even that and it would start toggling between mute and soundk all while buzzingk Annoyingk Then I found out that the model of iPhone was originally from either Korea or Japank making it so that I could not turn off the shutter sound when taking photosksnapshotsk highly annoyingk I looked through the packaging to find out there was a 90 day warranty and I just had to callkemail to get ahold of the company to fix the issuek Simplek and helpful rightk It would be if the company actually picked up the call or emailed you backk What a jokek I found out there are a couple work around a to these issues and I wasnkt happy doing themk but I didnkt want to be without a phone even for a couple daysk kwhy I paid for this one to be over nighted to my dorm roomk even though it ended up not able to be in my hands until two days after I was supposed tokk so I was going to keep itk Then it died at 40 some percent battery and now Ikm going to just return it and never deal with magic mobile partners againk Everk I would advise you and anyone else who asked me to do the samek Just when I thought I was going to actually like iPhonesk probably will just buy a new one as I would suggest you do too if you want onek Ikm very happy with itk And you cankt beat the pricek I made back up from iPhone 5 with the intent to restore data to the new phone the next morning after leaving the new phone to charge all nightk Battery was only at 52k  wouldnkt go above 54kk Requested Refundk So bad the product is breaking The front camera isnkt in the right spotk itks only half way in there but it works fine Works good and I am satisfied with the refurbished iphone 6k Almost like newk Do not buyk Whoever this is sold me a phone from Japan and Ikm sending it back because the camera sound will not turn offk They should have put it in the description that it would give me problemsk The phone started to curve after two days but itks not a problem because itks not that noticeablek Product and Service is flawlessk Arrived in perfect qualityk better than what I was expectingk iPhone was compatible with my ATT SIM card just as described and it arrived in the mail at the time mail usually arrives at my home ksince i requested next day deliverykk This iPhone was more than refurbishedk it came like new k I had a great experience all the way from ordering to activating itk it was just stress freek After purchasing my iPhonek I the amazing quality was more than worth what I paid fork Keep up the work guyskk The product came faultyk the antenna did not workk We agreed that I would repair it on my part to avoid having to return it since I was on vacation abroadk Could not repairk Sells products that do not workk Do not buy with himk The phone was in perfect working orderk It looked brand newk perfect conditionk The earphone did not come love it I was very excited about this purchasek The phone came in nice conditionk HOWEVERk it

review should any issues arisek Got my Iphone today no problems thanks Basically good but niggling problems will probably get it sent back thus product is absolutely amazingkwhen i bought u wasnt sure but when it arrived it was just like newk I have had it for about a week and it is perfectk it also will work with almost any servixe provider if you just buy that conoanies sim cardk FYI it is a nano sim card I was left very disappointed with this purchasek The battery was in very poor conditionk It says dies at about 30kk The phone wonkt connect to wifik The frame of the phone is bentk This is a poor excuse for a refurb k this phone is just used and brokenk I am returning thisk but am posting a review in hopes to warn othersk In great shapek Works wellk Very impressedk Good Product Works perfectlyk Ikm so happy to have a new working phonek The only little issue is that they had a sticker on the back of the phone under the plastic covering that I had to scrap off but otherwise it is amazingk I also love the colork I always went with the space gray but I decided to try the white and gold and it looks very pretty a little problem with automatic shut down on 20k ish batteryk

guys again Condition was specified new but there are visible scratch marks on the bodyk The charger provided is not an Apple accessoryk but some other company Sharkkk I was expecting original chargerk No earpods in the packagek Before reading the bad reviews and considering your optionk make sure you are aware of which seller the person bought the phone fromk I bought a space grey 16 gb iphone from the seller VIP Outlet and so far the product has been greatk I received it in a brown generic box including apple headphones and a charger cablek The phone looks brand newk and has no physical marksk It is functioning as good as a new Iphonek there was no problem switching my carrier overk the only thing I am concerned about is how long the battery life is suppose to run fork but since this is my first I phone I wonkt consider it a big dealk I recommend buying this product from VIP Outlet if you are considering getting this phonek Worked great until February 1stk It got hot while being charged and will not turn onk Of coursek the last day to return it was January 31stk Phone works fine for a day itks been a week and the battery goes from 100k to dead in an hour Donkt expect a new batteryk Ikve been using this phone for a weekk The battery will not hold a chargek Ikm disappointedk excellent Awesomek works and looks great Everything is great i think the battery was damaged beforek after i used one monthk when my phone chargek it restart over and over again and i can not use it anymorek worst phone k k Actually looks like brand newk I am so glad I can buy this phone by lower pricek 2 weeks with the phone and I really happy with this purchasek Very well thanks I could not be more happy with my phonek I live overseas and it was delivered eairlier than exapectedk This phone may be referbashed but it works and looks like newk The phone is nice but some features of the phone are not working I sent this phone to my employee and he has said that the assertive touch in the phone is not working another then itks ok k The phone came perfectly good conditionk The only two problems I have encountered so far is that you are unable to turn off the camera clicking sound and the battery had to be replaced because it would die at 20k which got annoying when I did not have a portable charger on mek Came in great condition but the camera shutter wonkt shut offk I looked up the reason and it said phones from Japan cankt turn off their camera shutterk but I donkt think this phone is from Japank Other than the camera shutterk itks greatk Butk I cannot take one picture without it making a loud sound so hard to take pics during classk No complaintsk Came as advertised Like brand newk I freaking love itk Goodk All night long EXCELENT kkk As far as we can tell it is just as good as a new onek Replaced our IPhone 5k No problem at allk Received Phone everything is good with the exception of screen being loosek Refurbished and certifiedk I guess does not mean in new conditionk I want to return it but I have already connected through my phone servicek The volume did not reach an audible rangek Location services inaccuratek Dies while there is still battery lifek dead on arrival out of the box Verte good It came a bit dirty  had fuzz stuff inside the charger port  the headphone jackk Also makes the camera noise when you take a picture weather or not if you turn the volume downk Thatks about it thoughk other than that I love itk Works as advertisedk Bought another similar phone off ebay for cheaperk After two returnsk we are buying through Amazon with no complaintsk Took a chance buying refurbished for the first time ever and it workedk Been using this as my main phone for about a month now with no problemsk the home button is a little cheap and feels weird when pressing but Ikm guessing thatks what was refurbishedk Otherwise great phone First time getting itk the camera was blurry and provides charger didnkt workk Second timek the charger provided didnkt workk Excellent Good conditionk But missing Headphonek Ikm actually writing this review on the iPhone 6 I bought herek It works absolutely FANTASTICk It is fastk looks newk and is everything the description saidk Howeverk I thought it would be useful for others to know that this does not come with a SIM cardk I didnkt know thisk and I had to go get one at Smithks kabout k20kk If you have a SIM card alreadyk it shouldnkt be a problemk I just didnkt have onek and had to buy one in order to set up the phonek No battery backup k need to keep on charging the phone kbetter to take the new phone than factory unlocked n k100 differs tats it Awful Itemk When I got this itemk I was pretty excited to use it but the item would not even startk i even tried charging it for a long time and yet no response from the systemk Should have read the feedback cause nowk when I am reading it many of them are unsatisfied customers like myselfk Amazon should look into this matter and not have such third party sellers who cannot provide the expectedk I brought this for my sonk It arrived in great conditionk I have to admit I was a little worried because it was not a new phonek No worriesk Phone came on time and was in very good condition k One scratch on the bottom next to the head phone socket but no big dealk Donkt get so terrified by the reviews It came Arvin a Great time And Works Wonderfully Great Place To Get Refurbished Unlocked Iphones EXCELLENT PRODUCT Ikm quite disappointed with thisk Ikm aware of the risks that come with refurbished electronicsk but to sell a product with a clear problem in the touch ic chipk knowing said problem cankt be fixedk is terriblek So Ikve pretty much tanked k400 on a phone thatks just steadily getting worse and cankt be repairedk Iphone came in like newk No scratchesk scuffk etck Very well cared for and comes with a USB Lighting cableknot OEMk but still works as well as a charging brickk Love the phonek no complaints apart from Itunes had a lot of emails connected to it that kept asking for a passwordk These were easily removed with an updatekRestore Looks new and works greatk On time shipping took So far so goodk my dad is happy with his phonek Arrived on time and works perfectlyk No issues at all Very happy with my iPhone 6 128GBk The phone looked and felt brand newk I didnkt find any scratches or scraps on itk I love itk I cankt turn off de cameraks Soundkkkk Even if I put it in silence moodkkk Idk whykkkkk kk Exactly what I wanted Works and looks like new nothing wrong with it and great pricekk Swagy swag fresh Worse refurbished phonesk I gifted my brother an iphone and within a week its touch stopped working k Screen hangs up everytime I try to use k It is so embarrassing to get a gift returned k It came with no scratches or cracks and a very fast chargerk Very happy with this phone Do not buy this productk Although the page states that the phones sent are unlocked and GSM4 compatiblek I received a verizon modelk which was not unlockedk Tkmobile could and would not unlock it for mek Works as expected It took an arm and a leg to turn onk but it was worth itk NO Phone in the boxk All that was in the box was 2 pieces of a Sharkk 3rd party chargerk DO NOT BUYk Got the phone without any scratches or any cosmetic issuek It ran fast and had a good battery lifek Unfortunately we werenkt able to turn off the camera shutter sound on any appsk which means that the phone is from a region that doesnkt allow the camera to be silentk This was disappointing as the rest of the phone was finek Returned itk DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLERk The phone isnkt refurbishedk itks broken and unusablek Updatek a few months laterk and there are even more problems with this phonek Applications crashk It sends me reminders for things I completed weeks agok and it sends a new reminder EVERY twenty minutesk This phone is barely useablek It sucksk I so wish I hadnkt bought itk And the seller never responded to me about any of these issuesk Old reviewk I like the look and feel of the phonek but it has kmanyk issuesk I was upgrading from a 5s and the 6 seems like a great pickk but this seller clearly is just turning over broken phones and not doing the whole refurbishing partkkk The first issue is that applications keep crashing while Ikm using itk This isnkt constantk but itks happened multiple timesk with various gameskbrowsersk so I donkt like thatk Another thing thatks even more annoying is that the volume doesnkt switch offk It pops back up to full volume  immediatelyk or on its own randomlyk Even when it IS in the mute positionk the phone makes noise when getting textsk or taking a photok I stopped by the Apple store to make sure I wasnkt confused and the Genius Bar woman was concerned and confused as wellk She said if the volume is switched to offk the camera shutter should knotk make noisek yet it doesk This is a nightmare at work when getting emails and textsk Itks very loud and annoyingk and this is embarrassingk It doesnkt stay in the mute positionk it constantly slides back upk But even while itks still in the mute positionk it doesnkt mute the soundsk There is a new problem as of todayk which is that it keeps saying my sent texts are undeliveredk with the red exclamationk but then people respond to themk So I never know if something went through or notk The final thing thatks been off is that the screen sometimes gets wavyk which Ikve never experienced before in a phonek The first time this happened I was taking a photo through a windowk so I didnkt think about it much and just assumed it was something to do with the glassk But itks happened a few times nowk while Ikm textingk or on Facebookk I donkt even know why it would do this I was expecting a used but perfect condition phonek This one clearly has some issuesk and itks not functioning as promisedk pretty damaged Boxed received todayk the phone was missing but I did receive the charger and cable broken Comes in generic box but was like newk I give 4 stars because the charger doesnkt work but the phone itself is excellent not really but it is ok defective batteryk This phone was a rip offk They stated when i bought it that it was unlocked but it turned out that it wasntk We were robbed of 350 + dollarsk Product was as describedk worked without any issues The phone was in perfect external conditionsk Charger and cable were not genuinek but worked like if they werek The problem was related to wifi and Bluetooth connectionsk WiFi dropped often and pairing with Applewatch was also inconsistentk I had to return the phone and ask for a refundk Excellent phone Phone is functional for the most partk but unfortunately it definitely shows signs of being refurbishedk I have a case on itk but if I drop it the screen will lift and I have to snap it back in placek The left edge of the screen doesnkt always probably eitherk And it freezes every once in a blue moonk Overall a workable phonek but was hoping to get more like new quality Excellent in generalk THEY DONT WORK AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS httpskkkwwwkamazonkcomkdpkB00YD54AYUkref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 Great product arrived in great conditionk I have got the mobile in good condition and so far I dont see any issues with itk The mobile charger in the kit is not of good quality but mobile is woth buying with some risk of being refurbished k No problems so fark I have always bought my unlocked phones from Amazonk Phone received had metal edging clearly bentkdented where a tool had been used to pry previous screen offk It made a single phone call before it quit workingk I contacted my carrier to find the phoneks IMEI # was locked since the phone had been previously reported stolenk The aluminum around the phone was separated by the volume buttonsk but had no scratches and worked just fine It came a couple days latek but overall good performance and exterior is goodk Exelent Product for not workkk Sent it back The acrewn was damage The phone is not staying chargedk I took it to apple and they told me that it needs a new batteryk For the price of buying a new battery I could get a new iPhone 6sk Text messages and calls donkt come through sometimesk I will never buy a refurbished phone againk I bought this phone and sent it to my brother in India as a giftk The charger stopped working within a week and I felt very embarassing as it was a giftk Now i am worried about the phone and wishing it to work for a good timek I wish I would have bought from some reputed sellers or may be apple or best buyk As describedk Works flawlesslyk Phone just as describedk Though it didnkt come with OEM packagingk but it looks brand new and no scratch both screen and back of phonek Thanks guys am enjoying my phone The Phone it self is perfect I had no signs of wear on it as a apple pro the only thing to say is if you are a first time iphone buyer DONT BUY FROM HEREkkk when I got the phone and used the charger that came with it it broke within the first hour of having it plugged in the whole prong was black like it shorted and then when i went to unplug the cord the prong got stuck in it and i had to work it out so if this is your first time hit up your local walmart or best buy and buy a cable these are genaric and may fail upon use Been a few months and its still working perfectlyk The phone came in mint condition and was set up in no time at allk This is the first used phone that Ikve ever bought and so I was a little apprehensive but it ended up exceeding my expectations as to the condition it came ink Not a single scratch or blemishk Without Headphone Without packaging factory I got compensation I should have read the reviews firstk Battery Not charging at allk Great phonek everything works perfectly This phone was exactly as expected and working wellk It was for my daughter and at a great pricek The phone was defectivek I could barely hear the callerk I bought this phone from Amazonks Certified Refurbished programk I was a little leery of buying a secondhand phonek but I have been an Amazon customer for many yearsk and have always had a great experiencek The few times Ikve ever had a problem with anything Ikve purchasedk kvery few times in many yearskk Amazon has taken great care to correct any issues in a very expedient mannerk so I have come to really trust themk I am a Prime Memberk I use the Prime Pantry Featurek I buy things off the regular sitek etck So I was more than willing to give the Certified Refurbished Phone Program a chancek Howeverk I still read EVERY single review from other people who had bought a phone this wayk And although there were some lesskthankcompletelykpositive reviewsk there were far more happy and satisfied customerk than notk So I bought my iPhone 6 knot Sk and it arrived 4 days earlier than expectedk it looks BRAND NEWk and it is in perfect working orderkk I could not be more happy with my phonek I also had great faith that if wasnkt happyk Amazon would make it rightk But fortunatelyk it is everything I was hoping it would bek and morek I was expecting to see some scratches on the glassk and the bodyk which I was already willing to live withk since the price was so goodk plus free Prime shippingk But this phone arrived looking absolutely brand newk with a charger that has a nice long cablek I already had a case for itk and headphonesk so I didnkt need to buy any other accessoriesk I couldnkt be happier or more impressed with this purchasek Very nicekkkI really like itk Great buy trouble free the best Good phone only problem I have with it is the charger is not that good but thatks not a big isssue Great great condition the charger wasnkt working though Sadly I was disappointed by both the certified and refurbished part of this iPhone 6k Besides the touch screen not working kor barely working kkk most of the time it didnkt respond to my touchesk 5to the point to where I couldnkt unlock my phonek which could be chalked up as somehow a glitch thatks software related kand thus less BuySpryks faultk kkk the speaker for taking on the phone also had static and there was a pockmark on the screen kkk clearly hardware issues that BuySpry should have refurbished and certifiedk This phone is greatk I was pretty worried about a refurbished product but I am pleasantly surprisedkkkso far have only had it a few days but it seems to work perfectly and is very exceptional in appearancek I am very happy with my purchase little scratch The original listing for this item did not indicate that it was refurbishedk I purchased from a listing which stated that the iPhone I was purchasing was Brand Newk not Refurbishedk dbk Review Datek on January 18k 2017k

but it seems to do everything expected of itk An obvious improvement over the 5 and I expect it to serve me wellk Although it is eligible for a tradekin for the new 7 during the month of September via my ATT plank I doubt that I will take advantage of thatk the main reason being the need for the wireless overkthekear phones which I donkt think I wantk Phone arrived in pristine conditionk as advertisedk Excellent service via Amazon Prime as usualk Extremely excited this phone is amazing Ikve only had it three days but it is beautiful great and I love it no problems as of yet and I sure

could give it no stars I wouldk Need more money back asap This iPhone doesnt Work at allk Battery dies in a couple of minutesk Completely dissapointedk The phone seems newk Worked exceptional for 1 full weekk In the 2nd week I was encountered with network issues as it failed to find any networkk Now Ikm forced to return the phone great condition Everyting went great Great phone works well no complaints Product was as expectedk I am satisfied and really hoping this refurb lastsk Yes I really love this itemk This was unbeatable offerk I was very satisfied with this productk It arrived with a cracked screen I got this from some friend in Asia and it work right out of the boxk the phone is use but it look new to me and it is unlock to use for any carrierk When I first got the phone I call Apple and give them IMEI number and it is clean phone no icloud lock or stolen phone I took a chance and ordered a referbished phone k The phone is in mint condition not a single scratch Ikm very pleasedkmoney well spent i would definitely buy from this seller again and would recommend to all i know Absolutely love itk Good item This was my second time buying an iphone on Amazon as the previous one was blacklistedk Upon arrivalk I noticed that this refurbished product never had its screen installed properlyk I could push the screen on the bottom right cornerk indicating that the screen itself wasnkt 100k in tactk I will be returning it as I didnkt sign up for thatk Alsok the screen is starting to not register my movementsk which sucksk Great Works like new The phone worked well for a week then it went into recovery mode every single time it was set down for just a few secondsk If that has never happened to you just know its VERY annoying because you cankt turn it back on you have to do a hard reset to turn it back every single timek When I bought the phone it said NEW so I was very disappointed to pay k500+ for a phone that didnkt workk I even took it to apple and they told me it had to be replaced but the phone had no warranty so it would be another k300k Therefore if you are buying from this seller be careful and atch your 30 day returnk I got this iphone in Octoberk2015 which looked good when I got itk But after 8 monthsk my phone got turned off overnight and its not turning onk Seller is saying that item is out of warrantykBut personally I have not heard of this kind of issue in iphonesk Very happy with this onek I ordered this phone for my daughter and she loves itk It works greatk Itks greatk Love the iphone 6k Its ok kkk Good condition k fast shipping k works fine with minor defect in screen but overall pretty good deal Right from the start this certified refurbished phone was often unresponsive and frequently froze upk The only way to revive it was to do a hard powerkoff and reboot itk and even that only worked some of the timesk I returned the phone and three weeks later got a replacementk which was even worsek I could not even activate itk as it was frozen from the startk Some onkline research has revealed that this problem is common with the iPhone 6k it is a design problem that has been labeled Touch Diseasek Apparently the touch chips on the logic board often partially break off and you get intermittent electrical connectionsk Ikll have to take it to an Apple store and see what they can do about itk Yes Great phonek Itks works perfectly finek This was actually the cheapest offer I seenk The phone came in great condition and works up to its potentialk I love it I was slightly skeptical after reading the reviewsk but the phone I received was in great conditionk Operates as if it is brand newk the battery is the only thing I can kind of critiquek It does not last as long as a brand new phone typically wouldk but they send you a brand new charger that to me makes up for itk Fantastic Very satisfied with purchase Very happy with the price and the quality thank you Excellent productk very satisfied with the purchasek Super recomendedk bought this phone new and the screen was already detached from the actual phonek The glass over the camera then proceeded to fall offk which I didnkt even know was possiblek This iPhone stopped working after 4 months of use and when I took it to the Apple store they said itks fake k not a refurbished iPhone as advertised by Amazonk Ikm very pleased with both the phone and the execution of my order by the resellerk He Phine came in perfect condition and is was brand newk Came with headphones and a chargerk The phone was real and had a perfect pricek This is definitely worth your moneyk Generally fine except that the battery life is way too shortk Needs to be charged more than once a dayk which is simply unacceptablek Love it Battery was not able sustain more than two hours I order gold and you bring me gray k And also itks not new k i love it Works perfectlyk I keep forgetting that itks not brand new kk looksk feelsk and acts brand newk Would definitely recommendk I had an issue with the charger pod not working but they sent out a replacement in a timely fashion and arrived a day or two laterk 10k10 Great conditionk no visible flaws whatsoeverk However be warned that the software in this phone had not been updated yetk kIt was still in 8 and the current software is iOS 9k3k4k It didnkt come with headphones still going 8 months laterkkk good productk Greatkkkk Excellentkkkkk They advertised a GSM iPhone and then sent a CDMA iPhone insteadk Tried to tell me it was the same network since I could use the iPhonek It would work if you like to access the internet at a dial up speedk Buyer bewarekkk yess nice it was I liked the iPhone 6 Itks perfect no defects and comes just with charger The phone sends pics and texts on its ownk Like the screen is being touched and selecting thingsk Also gets poor reception compared to other iPhones in the same room It is good Everything testedk Not so sure about thatk Mine was shipped with a loose home button and sticky side volume buttons to startk After a month of use the screen is starting to come off causing usage errorsk Extremely disappointedk I guess thatks what I get for being cheap and getting certified refurbishedk I shouldnkt have skimp on paying extra k158 for a brand new onek Lesson learned big timek Now I will have to buy a brand new one as this certified one has been acting up frequentlyk afraid it will not last much longerk Sadk Such a good price and it is perfectk Amazingkkk Not originalk Totally fakek This phone took a little while to get here although it did ktecnhicallyk arrive a couple days earlyk There were no scratches on the phone and it was incredibly easy to transfer to my plank Excellent so far great phonek Looks brand new works and works perfectly Does not work properlyk Just ordered a new onekk The phone is not unlockedk I had bought it for my nephew in Argentina and he cannot use itk This was the biggest stealk I am waiting for them

Ikm highly upset  I bought two refurbished iphone 6 in February of 2016 and both phones was broken by June same yrk Love it Hey its an iPhonek This phone was not working when we receivedk Keypad wouldnkt work on and offk Stay awaykkk bought phone not working anymore after a few months without doing anything unusual to itk Return policy is like 3 weeksk so disappointedk impossible to reach these folksk Definitely do not recommend they refurbished productsk The purchaser was pleased especially that it has 64GBk had no problem using this unlocked phone it was ready to go in the island Works greatkkk Very good Outstanding phonek as are most of the IPhone unitsk this particular unit has more than enough storage for musick picturesk and short videosk Excellent pricek high qualityk It is durable enough for my 13 year old for whom this was purchasedk Would highly recommend this unit and the sellerk Service was excellentk product was very competitively priced and delivered as promisedk Goodk Really like the iPhone 6k Fits nicely in purse or pocketk Still learning how to do all I can with itk Get better service with my carrier than on other cellkphones I have had especially in the building where I livek Will be holding on to this one a good whilek Charger stopped working within 2 wksk On day 97k volume button and antennae stopped working kit seems stuck in the pressed state with an icon remaining on the center of the screen for extended periods of timekk This does not seem like a coincidence considering there is a 90 day minimum warrantyk Apple states item is worth nothing and needs to be replacedk I have a useless item and was sold a lemonk I have requested to return this item and am waiting to hear back from the sellerk I am concerned that I may have just made a k599 donation to this company for three months use of this phonek I am also concerned that this is a kCertified Refurbishedk item through Amazonk Using the unlockedd phone in Costa Rica and works perfectk Most likley buy another Excelente The phone was really badk The home button doesn work goodk was broken and didn came with headphonesk Don recomend itk Product was as expected I was skepticalk but the product came in pristine conditionk There were no scratches or even a markk So far so goodk Thank you Exellent k It was ite Goodkkkk Ikm using it to write thiskkk Itks very fastk it has no problems yetk very fast and worth the moneyk The phone has a very large stain on the back and the front camera is not placed bine k Is it refurbishedkk Yesk Is it certifiedk I donkt believe sok The home button is not a smooth as my other iPhoneks home buttonk It is a small or big annoyance depending what were you expecting fork But from there everything is as you expected with an Apple iPhonek Everything perfectkk Everything went as plannedk DO NOT buy certified refurbishedk theykll rip you off of your moneyk After 3 months of having a normal functioning Iphonek the backlight of the screen has shut offk Although the phone is onk receiving callsk and making calls kvia Sirikk the phone is practically uselessk Nowk the warranty has expired and im left with kk500 to wastek Exactly what I wantedk I have so much storage I almost donkt know what to do with it all kD which is great cause my last phone had only 5 gb of storage and I was determined not to be constantly running out of storage againk Super easy to just move my old sim card from my iPhone 5 to this onek Using Straight Talk as my carrier and wasnkt sure if that would give me issues but it worked great Phone was poorly fixed k Bought it and screws fell out phone stopped workingkk The phone was locked even if itks written that itks factory unlocked I couldnkt activate Metro PCS sim card on this iPhone I was very nervous purchasing from an unknown company that couldkve easily ripped me offk but couldnkt afford a brand new phonek Very happy to say that Ikve had my phone for about 5 months now and there is absolutely nothing wrong with itk I works perfectlyk Ikm giving it a 4 because the mute and unmute button part rippedk Itks a great case just that part is badk That part will last you 3k4 months then ripk Other then that love the casek without accesories but it works Awseome Excellent service of deliveryk The phone is okk Love my iphone Works perfectlyk only a small scratch on the sidek Ikm not really satisfied coz front cover is not original k I love my iPhone 6k Very good had no problems with it and already had it for a few monthsk Mine came with the head phones and chargerk The phone is greatk I have it set up as a tracfonek Getting the Data working was a bit of paink God bless themk but tracfone support are helpless when it comes to BkYkOkphonek Turns out that to get the data to work you have to set up the AkPkN and MkMkCkS on an ikphone 6 but ikOkS will not let you manually adjust the settingsk The link tracfone provides for setting up this profile Did Not Workk for me at any ratek After a lot of google research I discovered this app that sets it up for youk Unlockitkcoknz it worked like a dreamk Now I have phone and datak I already had a tracfone log in so all I had left to do was down load the tracfone app from the app store so I could monitor my available minutesk skmks and datak I hope this helps others avoid a lot of frustrationk Ohk and straight talk is basically tracfone so this might help those users as wellk The phone itself looks brand new as far as I can tellk No scratches or ware and tare of any kindk No ear buds kas expectedk but it did come with the wall charger and lighting to USB cablek Call clarity has improved kcompared to ikphone 4k and Siri can be useful at timesk I have also used the google maps navigation app and it is an adequate replacement for a stand alone GPSk I highly recommend getting some kind of coverkcasek You donkt really need a screen protector thanks to gorilla glassk but you will regret dropping this phone as the corners will show impactsk It is a slippery little devilk it almost jumps out of your hand like the precious thing it isk I think the size is just right and the reach feature is helpfulk The only thing that would be better is battery lifek and for the love of god let me expand the memoryk This is the primary reason it only rates 4 starsk No headphones and no charger with it Bought it a couple months ago and still works goodk great conditionk excellent product It came with a defective battery Phone is as describedk WARNING DO NOT BUY this itemkkk Save yourself the headache and

unlocked I returned it This phone was listed as certified refurbished and in like new conditionk When it arrivedk it first seemed to be in good conditionk until I turned it onk It wouldnkt connect to

only for a few minutesk It has taken resetting it for over half an hour straight just to get it to connectk The phone also freezes many times a day and resets on its ownk and has done this since the

6k love it Had to buy two new partsk Excelente GREAT CONDITIONkk It appears that this product kwhich was VERY expensivek only has a one month warranty against failurek Based on the previous reviews from this companyk I thought that would be sufficient but aliask I was wrongk My cell phone is basically useless knot working properlykk Ikve taken it in to Apple and they cankt do anything since we purchased it from a second party; we will have to pay them full price to get the phone into working orderk I strongly suggestk if you are going to purchase APPLE electronics that you purchase them from APPLEk I wonkt purchase from this company againk The phone came quickly and works greatk Just day one but I am loving this phonekkk It was super easy to set up from my last one and works just like a new phonek It came with all the extra parts too like the charging cordk boxk and even new headphonesk Was in the iPhone box and everything packaged like it was never used beforek Certainly

Excellent Works and looks like a new onek This is strictly a product review as the seller was very expeditious and professionalk The design and features are as good as expected for a company as successful as Applek Howeverk I was extremely disappointed whenk after a few days having the phonek dropped it and the screen shattered to the point where it just didnkt workk It wasnkt thrown or dropped fromy very highk Sok durability is nowhere near where it should bek This was my first iPhonek coming from a long time Samsung userk Needless to sayk I went back with SamsungkGS6 edgek and am just disappointed that I wasted the money on the iPhonek Apple cankt say I didnkt give them a chancek howeverk back to the practical smart phone for mek Came earlier than expected and good qualityk It arrived fine and looked much like it was describedk Howeverk it will not hold a charged and has to ist on the charger after only 5 hrs kwith almost EVERYTHINGk turned offk I did really like the extra
